# Accessibility:
- Various forms of disability or impairment
    - Vision
    - Speech
    - Touch
    - Sensor-Motor

- Can a page be accessed by people with impairment?
- How can the accessibilty of a page be improved?

- W3.org - World wide web Consortium (W3C) - accessibility guidelines
https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/


# Standards:
- Interplay between many components of a page:
    - Web content: HTML, images, script, etc
    - User-agent: desktop browser, mobile browser, speech-oriented browser, assistive devices
    - Authoring tools: text editor, word processor, compiler


# Some w3 principles:
## Principle - Perceivable
- Provide `text alternatives` for non-text content.
- Provide `captions and other alternatives` for multimedia. (like captions)
- Create content that can be `presented in different ways`, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.
- Make it easier for user to `see and hear content`

## Principle - Operable
- Make all functionality availabe from a `keyboard`.
- Give user `enough time` to read and use content.
- Donot use content that cause `seizures` or physical reactions.
- Help users `navigate and find content`.
- Make it easier to use `input other than keyboard`.

## Principle - Understandable
- Make text `readable and understandable`.
- Make content appear and operate in `predictable` ways.
- Help users `avoid and correct mistakes`. (like add a text box that accepts numbers only)

## Priciple - Robust
- Maximize `compaitibility` with current and future user tools.



# Asthetics:
- Visual appearance
- VERY important
- Simplicity preferred
- Can vary with time!
    - ex: apple logo over time


# Summary:
- View - any output seen by human or machines
- User-Interface and User-Interaction guidelines
