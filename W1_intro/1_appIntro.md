# What's an app?
- An app is a computer program, in particular the specic one used in our mobile device
- The term app was evolved to refer to small programs that can be downloaded and installed all at once
- An app is meant to be a smaller version of a full fledge application that we use on PC

- VS code is an advance text-editior 

# Desktop apps:
- Usually a standalone program, means we can use it without needing an active internet connection
- Because they were meant to run Offline in old days, so it needs to have localStorage to use Desktop app

## SDK:
- The way these application is develolped is using SDK(Software developer Kits)
- These are usually custom framework that are generally OS specific
- So if you're developing for Windows, its unlikely that they will run on other OS without changes

# Mobile apps:
- Now days the main targets for apps are mobile platforms
- These platforms have constraints like: Limited Screen Space, UI(touch, audio, camera), low Memory/processing, low Power
- They have low memory and low processing due to power constraint
- They are usually network oriented
- Twitter, instagram, amazon shopping app all of them are just connecting us with the server at their end that are giving us informations through apis'


## SDK:
- Some of them are ecosystem specific like apple apps
- To develop an app for iphone, one need to use SWIFT language with apple's SDK
- The good thing is the app developed on iphone, can most probably works on ipad or a mac
- We have a number of frameworks that helps us built a cross-platform app, i.e. works both on apple and android

# Web apps:
- Works across all devices: Creates a common base
- Heavily Network dependent
- The idea is, browsers are already available for various platforms like apple, linux, windows, android etc
- Web app talks to the browser, Browsers talk to the OS. 
- This changed every thing since browser can talk to multiple operating but talk to web app in single language




"These webapps are gonna be the main focus of this course
