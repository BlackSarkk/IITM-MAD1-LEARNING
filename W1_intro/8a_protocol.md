# What is Protocol:
- Both sides agree on how to talk:
    - eg: Walk into a room, greet each other, shake hands, sit down, chat about weather

- Server expects "requests"
    - Nature of request
    - Nature of client
    - Types of result client can deal with

- Client expects "responses"
    - Ask server for something
    - Convey what you can accept
    - Read result and process

- When client connects to a server, both of them needs to know what kind of information they can expect from each other, and what kind of information it is likely to respond with
- This agreed set of rules is called a protocol.



# HyperText Transfer Protocol: HTTP
- Primarily text based
- Requests specified as "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", etc
    - Headers can be used to convey acceptable response types, languages, encoding
    - Which host to connect to (if multiple hosts on single server)
- Responses headers
    - convery message type, data
    - cache information
    - status code: 404 not found... 

- HTTP is a very specific type of protocol, it is very text based, it has some encoded text to make things happen


# Use cases:
- GET: simple request, search queries, etc
- POST: more complex form data, large text block, file uploads
- PUT/DELETE/..: - rarely used in WEB1.0
                 - Extensively used in WEB2.0
                 - Basis of most APIs - REST, CRUD



# Another Web server:
```bash
python -m http.server           #<-- This is a one line webserver in default port (8000)
python -m http.server 1500      #<-- This is a one line webserver in specified port
```
- Serves files from local folder
- Understands basic HTTP requests
- Gives more detailed headers and responses

- here -m says to execute something, like take the module http and run the funciton server out of that http module

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000    # Use this to connect to http server created 
```

Note: 
- If the folder is empty where we did "python -m http.server" then "curl -v http://localhost:8000" will show a default directory listing HTML generated by Python’s HTTP server.
- If we create a file there in the empty folder called index.html then the curl will show the content of your index.html instead of showing the directory listing.
