# Markup vs Style

<h1>hello</h1>
- Markup doesnot tell you what an element would look like
- The beautification part is styling

# Seperation of Styling 
- Style hints in seperate blocks
    - Seperate files included

- Themes

- Style Sheets
    - Specify presentation information

- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    - Allow multiple definations
    - Last one takes precedence
