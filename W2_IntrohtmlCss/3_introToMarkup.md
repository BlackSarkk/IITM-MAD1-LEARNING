# Markup:
- Content vs Meaning:
    - Markup is a way of using cues or codes in the regular flow of text to indicate how text should be displayed.
    - Markup is very useful to make the display of text clear and easy to understand
    - Coombs et al, "Communication System and the Future of Scholarly Text Processing". Communications of ACM, 1987 - they defined how a markup of a doc should be done

- Types of markup:
    - Presentational 
        - WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get): directly format output and display.
        - Embeded codes not part of regular text, specific to the editor.

    - Procedural
        - Deals on how to display something:
            - change font to large, bold
            - skip 2 lines, indent 4 columns
        - Every single steps needs to be mentioned   
        - Not much efficient

    - Descriptive
        - This is <title>, this is <heading>, this is a <paragraph>


- Examples:
    - Ms Word, Google Docs, etc...
        - User interface focused on "appreance", not meaning
        - WYSIWYG: direct control over styling
        - Often leads to complex formatting and loss of inherent meaning

    - LaTeX, HTML (general *ML)
        - Focus on meaning
        - More complex to write and edit, not WYSIWYG in general



# Semantic Markup:
- Content vs Presentation
- Semantics
    - Meaning of the text
    - Structure or logic of the document
